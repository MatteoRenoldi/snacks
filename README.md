Snack size awesome list for Social Network Analysis resources


## Intro
Not another awesome list.<br>
While awesome lists can indeed be awesome, they can also be daunting and evoke a strong sense of FOMO.
This repo's mission is to be a snack size version of an awesome list, providing a highly curated, human friendly, and most importantly digestable list of resources for anyone interested in SNA.
</br>
</br>

The idea here is that unlike an awesome list, one can definitely get though all the resources here, and come out the other end knowledgeable and happy.

## Getting Started

0. Play with Nick Case's excellent [the wisdom and/or madness of crowds â€“ an interactive guide to human networks](https://ncase.me/crowds/) to get some inspiration. This is not a must step in your learning journey, but could definitely make you excited and hungry to learn more.

1. [D3 Graph Theory - learn graph theory interactively](https://d3gt.com/index.html) - a friendly broswer based introduction to grpah theory. This is a great place to get started and learn the terminology, basics, and logic behind it all.

2. Nailed down the basic theory? Great! Next step is to get your hands dirty and see it in action in Python. 

- `pip install networkx` (docs can be found [here](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/index.html))

- Then take 3 hours for: **Workshop: [Mridul Seth](https://github.com/MridulS), [Eric Ma](https://github.com/ericmjl) - Network Analysis Made Simple - PyCon 2019.** [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZs4MECCuYY), and [notebooks](https://github.com/ericmjl/Network-Analysis-Made-Simple).
