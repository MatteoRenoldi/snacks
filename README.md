Snack size awesome list for Social Network Analysis resources


## Intro
Not another awesome list.
While awesome lists can indeed be awesome, they can also be daunting and evoke a strong sense of FOMO.
This repo's mission is to be a snack size version of an awesome list, providing a highly curated, human friendly, and most importantly digestable list of resources for anyone interested in SNA.

The idea here is that unlike an awesome list, one can definitely get though all the resources here, and come out the other end knowledgeable and happy.

Still want the awesome list? [Look no further](https://github.com/briatte/awesome-network-analysis).
